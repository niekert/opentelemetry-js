This may be actually &#34;in flight&#34; in some languages (e.g. if the exception
is passed to a Context manager&#39;s `__exit__` method in Python) but will
usually be caught at the point of recording the exception in most languages.

It is usually not possible to determine at the point where an exception is thrown
whether it will escape the scope of a span.
However, it is trivial to know that an exception
will escape, if one checks for an active exception just before ending the span,
as done in the [example above](#exception-end-example).

It follows that an exception may still escape the scope of the span
even if the `exception.escaped` attribute was not set or set to false,
since the event might have been recorded at a time where it was not
clear whether the exception will escape.
